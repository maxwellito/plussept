plusSept
========

plusSept is a Google Chrome extension to bypass the geographic restrictions on arte.tv player (and also the time protection to can watch night time shows during the day). This is not using any proxy or external services, just overriding some scripts from arte.tv. No personnal data is collected, no extra resquests are done. About permissions, this extension is only executed on arte.tv domain.
So if you live outside of France or Germany, enjoy arte.tv again, easily.

How to use it?
--------------
Download the extension package on https://raw.github.com/maxwellito/plussept/master/plussept.crx then install it (a simple drag and drop on chrome://extensions/ page should be ok).

Code
----
For the record, this is my first Chrome extension. I'm sure the code can be improuved (a lot!). If a master want to give me a hand: you're welcome!
To make the build, I've used the 'Pack extension' feature in Chrome. I've kept the key (.pem) for me, of course.
Built with http://extensionizr.com/

FAQ
---
Why the extension is not available on Chrome Web Store?
Well.. I don't think I'm respecting the terms and conditions with what I'm doing, and Arte might not appreciate too. So let's keep it here :-)
